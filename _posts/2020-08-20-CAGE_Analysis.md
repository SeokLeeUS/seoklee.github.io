I thought about why [Costco succeeds in their global expansion](https://www.occstrategy.com/cn/%E6%AC%A7%E6%99%B0%E6%9E%90%E8%A7%82%E7%82%B9/insight/id/5303/what-does-costcos-successful-debut-in-china-tell-us-about-todays-retail-market), but [Walmart failed and ended up with withdrawal from some regions](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/business/worldbusiness/02walmart.html).
