### Deliver quality in uncertain environment:

*Uncertainty* is everywhere. In the engineering field, there are often no defined requirements or clear direction.Trial and error is a working way to discover unknowns. I learned and developed hands-on project management where uncertainty is the norm. At the same time, the exposure to the research environment where there's minimal guidance to demand creative outputs fortifies me. In both sides of the world, I am able to deliver high quality deliverable where uncertainty rises and falls.  

### Leadership is meant to enable others:

*Leadership* is not something you can sandbox- fail, improve, and repeat because the human emotion is involved. I noticed that leadership may end up performance degradation adversely when itâ€™s exercised wrong.I envisioned leadership as an art of harmonizing humane emotion while creating an environment to deliver the project deliverable spontaneously. The formal education in MBA enabled me to utilize few tools to enhance my past earned leadership skills to enable others to achieve the group's career goal.  

### Solve complex problem:

*My passion* lies in developing solutions for complex systemic issues. The journey to prove the proposed solutions at system level makes feel rewarding and that is where my excitement arises. 

### Open minded in global setting:

*Exposure* to the global presence in working in European region enlightened me to carry a holistic view of corporate operation. I see why one size fits all strategy wouldn't work because of different labor resources, locality, and custom. Specialized in corporate globalization in MBA certainly broadens and affirms my collective view from international assignment. 

### Experienced in data driven approach:

*Acquiring* insights from data is easier said than done. The data size is unwelcoming and overwhelms at first. Data mining is monotonous and tedious. Insufficient data requires long waiting and change of data acquisition method. At then end, frustration arrives when the conclusive pattern or an insight isn't seen. Unskillful coding and visualization will add stress under time demanding project. However, the delight after discovering patterns or estimating / forecasting next behavior endures hectic prepping work. I have gone through in both engineering or business analytic areas.       

### A versatile in engineering field: 
Following engineering specialties synergize in different disciplines:

##### - *Mathematical Modeling for System*
##### - *Data Analytic Driven Decision Making*
##### - *Virtual Simulation to Mimic Real World*
##### - *Design Estimator to Predict Nonlinearity*
##### - *Model Based Approach to Develop Readable and Simplified s/w Code*
##### - *AI, Vision Sensing for Pattern Recognition, Path Following*
##### - *Business Data Analytics to Predict Patterns*
