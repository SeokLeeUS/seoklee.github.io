I have gone through multple re-organizations throughout my career. Most of time when the senior leadership changes, the first thing after inauguration is re-organzation. 
I assumed it's related to an arbiturary milestone- [demonstrating accomplishment from the first 100 days](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/04/16/the-first-100-days-when-did-we-start-caring-about-them-and-why-do-they-matter/). 
However, I haven't found a good re-organization which made employees satisfied. (or, it may not be ever possible to satisfy all of employees)  
Today, I was curious about what is successful formula of organization structure and leadership. I have two examples- [good](https://www.fastcompany.com/48871/and-now-hard-part) and [bad](https://hbr.org/1999/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-j-peterman-company).
Here is [my thought](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sa9_RjUZjLebLn51fVPznqlXb7qrCWX1KJL9xxPZAQg/edit).
