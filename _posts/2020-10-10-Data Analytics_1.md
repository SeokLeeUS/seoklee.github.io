I practiced a capstone project for business data analytics. 

The scope of project is to understand if there's a correlation for a client to cancel the hotel booking. 

The repeating customer makes less cancellation than a new customer. 

The hotel company should apply more promotion to retain the loyal customers minimizing incurring cost of no show or last minute cancellation. 

Main programming tool was R for this work. 

Full result will be shown in pdf once you click the screenshot.
