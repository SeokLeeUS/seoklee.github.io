I worked on a capstone project for business data analytics, focusing on identifying factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations.

The project's scope was to examine whether there is a correlation between client type and cancellations. Results indicated that repeat customers are less likely to cancel bookings compared to new customers.

Based on these findings, the hotel company should prioritize promotional strategies to retain loyal customers, thereby minimizing costs associated with no-shows and last-minute cancellations.

The analysis was conducted using R programming. Full results are available in a PDF, accessible via the provided screenshot.
