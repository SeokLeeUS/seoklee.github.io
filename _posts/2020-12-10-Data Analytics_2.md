I practiced a team project for business data analytics. 

We circulated surveys to find out the correlation between demographic data and MBA student satisfaction. 

R programming language was used for data mining, analysis. Qualtrics was used for survey.  

My hypothesis was, working professional will have great satisfaction because of program flexibility (fully online).

Data proved the hypothesis. Full result will be shown in pdf once you click the screenshot.
