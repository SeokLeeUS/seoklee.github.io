On a sleepy Sunday evening, I embarked on a noble quest to Target, armed with a mission: to procure cold medicine for my ailing daughter. Little did I know, I was about to stumble upon a scene straight out of a reality TV show. 

A horde of softball players, fresh off the field, had descended upon the Starbucks (ticker: SBUX) within the store. Their mom, a modern-day sugar mama, was poised to shell out over $50 for a round of overpriced caffeinated concoctions. I couldn’t help but pause. Fifty bucks? That’s a week’s worth of groceries for some folks! 

It got me thinking: What is it about SBUX that keeps people coming back for more? Is it the overpriced lattes? The cozy ambiance? Or perhaps the illusion of sophistication? Only time, and a lot of caffeine, will tell. 

Here is [my thought on this scene](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3kIv4jYsKpbldzq3DZ24hz8u-PrWijcnblH9VaQ0IA/edit).
