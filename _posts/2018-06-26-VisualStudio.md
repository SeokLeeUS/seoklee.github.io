- I am putting few good tips for Visual Studio (VS) setting to work with Unreal engine. 

   - [Setting up VS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/index.html)
   - [Unreal VS extension](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/UnrealVS/index.html)
   - [Visual Assist- this is a paid s/w helps development](https://www.wholetomato.com/)
   - Turn off squggles @ VS options->Text Editor->C/C++>Advanced->Intellisense->Disable Squiggles "True"
   - VS code is also working with Unreal (4.18 or higher). 
   - How to set up VS code to use VS compiler is, 
     -Go to File, Settings, type shell, then look for Edit in settings.json.
