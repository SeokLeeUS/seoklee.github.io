I tried to mimic Warren Buffett's investment style. When someone asked Buffett about his investment strategy, Buffett often introduced the concept of ["economic moat"](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp). I was struck with the idea that the concept of "moat" could be understood in the framework suggested by [Porter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp) - 5 force. 
5 force stands for the followings:

- Competition in the industry

- Potential of new entrants into the industry

- Power of suppliers

- Power of customers

- Threat of substitute products

In the end, I applied the suggested framework to an industry I am familiar with- Heavy Duty engine industry. 
Here is [my speculation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BD391G2G1-APvGuatAIfOk_hczL-wCmKsHDytlCK63Y/edit).
