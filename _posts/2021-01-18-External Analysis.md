I tried to mimic Warren Buffett's investment style. One of his quote when someone asked about his investment strategy, he introduced economic moat. 
I found there's a framework suggested by [Porter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp) - 5 force. 
5 force stands for the followings:

- Competition in the industry

- Potential of new entrants into the industry

- Power of suppliers

- Power of customers

- Threat of substitute products

I tried to apply the suggested framework to an industry I am familar with- Heavy Duty engine industry. 
Here is [my speculation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BD391G2G1-APvGuatAIfOk_hczL-wCmKsHDytlCK63Y/edit).
