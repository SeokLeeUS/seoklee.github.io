I attempted to emulate [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett)'s investment approach. When asked about his strategy, Buffett often referred to the concept of an ["economic moat"](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp). I was intrigued by the idea and realized that the "moat" concept could be analyzed through Five Forces framework by [Porter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp).
5 force stands for the followings:

- Competition in the industry

- Potential of new entrants into the industry

- Power of suppliers

- Power of customers

- Threat of substitute products

I applied this framework to an industry I know wellâ€”the heavy-duty engine industry. 
Here is [my analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BD391G2G1-APvGuatAIfOk_hczL-wCmKsHDytlCK63Y/edit).
