I thought about what would be a good way to understand business model after seeing disruptive technology takes down the incumbent like Netflix vs. Blockbuster. 
There's an existing framework (VARS) for dissecting a business into the following 4 criteria:

V = Value proposition
A = Activities, capabilities, and resources
R = Revenue Model (or realized values)
S = Scope of the firm

Here is [my thought](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OND5UdRMp4QY7n5Wt3NL9VCh3GI9k6qtrUgVxnDSma4/edit) on [a startup business](https://ineedahand.com/) I have involved at some point of its development.
