>- I am motivated to learn more in details about machine learning/computer vision after completing Udacity self driving car nano degree.  
>
>- I graduated Udacity Nano degree recently. Since the schedule was tight because I am working while the learning curve was stiff to grasp many of new topics, I rushed to dip my toe on the surface of certain topics/tools. Therefore, I determined to revisit some of subjects/skills/programming languages, not only to sharpen my skillset, but also to gain deeper knowledge/practical experience.

>- In order to do so, here is the skill gaps (things to learn) which I observed and how to enhance:

|Subject|Things to learn|Small goal|
|---|---|---|
|Technical writing|Revisit how to write a technical paper|Complete a Coursera course|
|Unix/Git|Understand commonly used Unix tool/command|- Take a course to have general overview of Linux environment <br>- Install Ubuntu on my laptop for deep learning and computer vision|
|Image annotation|utilize an existing tool to annotate the image|- Practice to annotate the traffic signal images to prepare YOLO/SSD works|
|Data importing/exporting|OPENCV <br> Python <br> Tensorflow|- Take OpenCV course <br> - Take Python data science specialization course <br>- Take Coursera self driving car specialization course <br>- Take Tensorflow course <br>- Determine the best way to import and process traffic signal images and visualize the data importing process nicely|
|Data representation|matplotlib|- Do benchmark how other cohorts represented the image processing result using matplotlib <br>- Do go over codes and implemented in my own way for the later usage <br>- Review and implement in the same way how some of deep learning papers represent the data images|
|Vision sensing/image processing|- OpenCV <br>- Python|- Create a small program to recognize hand-writting image <br>- Make sure to visualize the steps of image processing|
|Deep learning|OpenCV|Complete the OpenCV course <br> Go back to the algorithm(undone from the last capstone) to detect traffic light from Bosch traffic signal data set|
|Deep learning|Classification, not limited to CNN,YOLO,SSD|Keras <br> Tensorflow|Create an algorithm to detect my daughter's face in real time|
