I’m eager to delve deeper into the fascinating worlds of machine learning and computer vision, building upon the solid foundation laid by the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

While the Nanodegree provided a whirlwind tour of these fields, I confess that I often felt like a kid in a candy store, overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. To rectify this, I plan to revisit key concepts and tools, turning my surface-level understanding into a more profound knowledge.

My immediate goal is to bring real-time image recognition to life using YOLO or SSD. And, in a bold move, I aspire to hone my technical writing skills by crafting conference paper-worthy documents.

To accomplish these lofty ambitions, I’ve identified the following areas for improvement:

|Subject|Things to learn|Small goal|
|---|---|---|
|Technical writing|Revisit how to write a technical paper|- Complete a Coursera course|
|Unix/Git|Understand commonly used Unix tool/command|- Take a course to have general overview of Linux environment <br>- Install Ubuntu on my laptop for deep learning and computer vision|
|Image annotation|utilize an existing tool to annotate the image|- Practice to annotate the traffic signal images to prepare YOLO/SSD works|
|Data importing/exporting|OPENCV <br> Python <br> Tensorflow|- Take OpenCV course <br> - Take Python data science specialization course <br>- Take Coursera self driving car specialization course <br>- Take Tensorflow course <br>- Determine the best way to import and process traffic signal images and visualize the data importing process nicely|
|Data representation|matplotlib|- Do benchmark how other cohorts represented the image processing result using matplotlib <br>- Do go over codes and implemented in my own way for the later usage <br>- Review and implement in the same way how some of deep learning papers represent the data images|
|Vision sensing/image processing|- OpenCV <br>- Python|- Create a small program to recognize hand-writting image <br>- Make sure to visualize the steps of image processing|
|Deep learning|OpenCV|- Complete the OpenCV course <br>- Go back to the algorithm(undone from the last capstone) to detect traffic light from Bosch traffic signal data set|
|Deep learning|Classification, not limited to CNN,YOLO,SSD based on Keras and Tensorflow|- Create an algorithm to detect my daughter's face in real time|
