I am motivated to learn more in details about machine learning/computer vision. 

I completed Udacity Nano degree recently. Since the schedule was tight, I felt I need to revisit some of skills/programming language to sharpen my skillset. The intermediate goal is to make YOLO (You ONLY Look ONCE) or SSD work for real timeimage recognition. The last goal is to write a practical note, but the quality/format is similar to a conference paper. 

In order to do so, here is the skill gaps which I observed:

|Subject|Things to learn|Small goal|
|---|---|---|
|Image annotation|pick up existing free tool| to annotate images to prepare YOLO/SSD works|
|Data processing|OPENCV,python, tensorflow, Keras| how to import and process external custom data to teach the model|
|Vision sensing/image processing|OpenCV, Python| Create a small program to recognize hand-writting image|
|Deep learning|OpenCV|go back to the algorithm to detect traffic light from Bosch traffic signal data set|
|Deep learning|CNN,YOLO,SSD|Keras,Tensorflow|Create an algorithm to detect my daughter's face in real time|
