I am motivated to learn more in details about machine learning/computer vision after completing Udacity self driving car nano degree.  

I graduated Udacity Nano degree recently. Since the schedule was tight and the learning curve was stiff, I rushed to learn only the surface of many of topics/tools. I determined to revisit some of subjects/skills/programming languages, not only to sharpen my skillset, but also to gain deeper knowledge/practical experience.

The intermediate goal is to make YOLO (You ONLY Look ONCE) or SSD (Single Shot Detection) work for real time image recognition. The ultimate goal is to practice a techincal writing. The quality/format is similar to a conference paper. 

In order to do so, here is the skill gaps which I observed:

|Subject|Things to learn|Small goal|
|---|---|---|
|Technical writing|revisit how to write a technical paper|Complete a Coursera course|
|Unix/Git|understand commonly used Unix tool/command|Take a course to have general overview of Linux environment/ install Ubuntu on my laptop for deep learning and computer vision|
|Image annotation|utilize an existing tool to annotate the image| to annotate the traffic signal images to prepare YOLO/SSD works|
|Data importing/exporting|OPENCV,python, tensorflow,matplotlib|Take OpenCV course/ Take Coursera self driving car specialization course, Take Tensorflow course, then determine the best way to import and process traffic signal images and visualize the data importing process nicely(I can benchmark some of papers how they represent the data images)|
|Vision sensing/image processing|OpenCV, Python| Create a small program to recognize hand-writting image, make sure to visualize the steps of image processing|
|Deep learning|OpenCV|complete the OpenCV course, go back to the algorithm(undone from the last capstone) to detect traffic light from Bosch traffic signal data set|
|Deep learning|CNN,YOLO,SSD|Keras,Tensorflow|Create an algorithm to detect my daughter's face in real time|
