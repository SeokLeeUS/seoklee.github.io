## Data Set Summary & Exploration

### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

* Load pickled data (of which data type is dict) and extract train/valid/test dataset of German traffic sign.

```python
X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
print('X_train.shape:',X_train.shape)
X_valid, y_valid = valid['features'], valid['labels']
print('X_valid.shape:',X_valid.shape)
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']
print('X_test.shape:',X_test.shape)
```

* In order to examine images, plot German signs randomly. 

```python
index = random.randint(0, len(X_train))
print('random index',index)
image = X_train[index].squeeze()
print('image.shape:',image.shape)

w = 10
h = 10
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 13))
columns = 4
rows = 5
ax = []

for i in range( columns*rows ):
    #img = np.random.randint(10, size=(h,w))  
    index = random.randint(0, len(X_train))
    img = X_train[index].squeeze()
    
    # create subplot and append to ax
    ax.append( fig.add_subplot(rows, columns, i+1) )
    ax[-1].set_title("ax:"+str(i))  # set title
    plt.imshow(img)

plt.show()  # finally, render the plot
```
![Random_Sign1](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/germantrafficsign_random-Udacity.png)


* Obtain the number of images by using pandas read_csv attribute and extract other number of image datsets:

```python
import pandas as pd
my_csv = pd.read_csv('signnames.csv')
ClassId_Name = my_csv.ClassId
Sign_Name = my_csv.SignName

print(len(ClassId_Name))
```

```python
n_train = len(X_train)
n_validation = len(X_valid) 
n_test = len(X_test)
image_shape = X_train.shape
n_classes = len(ClassId_Name)

print("Number of training examples =", n_train)
print("Number of testing examples =", n_test)
print("Image data shape =", image_shape)
print("Number of classes =", n_classes)

.
.
.
Number of training examples = 34799
Number of testing examples = 12630
Image data shape = (34799, 32, 32, 3)
Number of classes = 43

```

### 2. Data visualization

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data ...

![data_visualization](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/germantrafficsign_data_visualization1.png)

## Design and Test a Model Architecture

### a. Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

There are  things to consider:
- pre-processing techniques (normalization, graying out, centralization, standardization, whitening)
- Neural network architecture
- [Hyper parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning))
  - batch/epoch size
  - learning rate

  * Pre-process the image- (Normalization, grayscale)

    - Normalization: I follow the method of normalization by referring to the following references: 
      - [Ref#1](https://deepestdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/003_image_processing/0030/)
      - [Ref#2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling)
    
    - Grayscale: In terms of grayingscale pre-processing, image classification in this project doesn't necessarily deal with color channel. In order to cut down complexity which in turn resulted in consuming computational power, grayscale was chosen as part of pre-processing. 
    


```python
# normalization for pre-processing
def normCNN(X):
    X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1]*X.shape[2]*X.shape[3])
    # normalization
    X_norm = (X-255)/255
    # centeralization
    #X_norm = X_norm - X_norm.mean(axis=0)
    # standardization
    #X_norm = X_norm/np.std(X_norm, axis = 0)
    # rescaling to set between 0 and 1    
    return X_norm
    
 def RescaleCNN(X):
    X_rescaled = (X - X.min()) / (X.max() - X.min())  
    return X_rescaled
```

```python
def grayscale(image):
    return np.sum(image/3, axis=3, keepdims=True)
```

```python
X_train_n = RescaleCNN(normCNN(grayscale(X_train)))
X_valid_n = RescaleCNN(normCNN(grayscale(X_valid)))
X_test_n =  RescaleCNN(normCNN(grayscale(X_test)))
```

### b. Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling and normalization

- raw image:

 ![raw image](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/raw_image_preprocessing.png)


- normalized image:

 ![normalized image](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/norm_image_preprocessing.png)

- grayscaling& normalizated image:

 ![normalized grayed_image](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/norm_grayed_image_preprocessing.png)

- examine convoluted images:
```python

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
#img = img.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([3,3,1,5],stddev = 0.01))
conv2d = tf.nn.conv2d(img_reshape,W1,strides = [1,2,2,1],padding = 'SAME')
print(conv2d)
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
conv2d_img = conv2d.eval()
conv2d_img = np.swapaxes(conv2d_img,0,3)
for i, one_img in enumerate(conv2d_img):
    # plt.subplot(1,5,i+1), plt.imshow(one_img.reshape(14,14),cmap ='gray')
    plt.subplot(2,5,i+1), plt.imshow(one_img.reshape(16,16),cmap ='gray')
```
 ![convoluted_image](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/convoluted.png)

- examine maxpool images:
```python

# check maxpooling image
# max pool image
pool = tf.nn.max_pool(conv2d,ksize=[1,2,2,1],strides=[1,2,2,1],padding='SAME')
print(pool)
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
pool_img = pool.eval()
pool_img = np.swapaxes(pool_img,0,3)
for i, one_img in enumerate(pool_img):
    plt.subplot(1,5,i+1),plt.imshow(one_img.reshape(8,8),cmap = 'gray')
```

## Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

- Feb212019: revisited training model due to instable robustness which resulted in poor accuracy. 

My final model consisted of the following layers:

```python

def LeNet2(X):
    
    L1 = tf.layers.conv2d(X,32,[5,5],activation=tf.nn.relu,padding = 'SAME')
    #print(L1)

    L1 = tf.layers.dropout(L1, 0.3, is_training)

    #print(L1)

## Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

| Characteristics        		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Optimizer        		| AdamOptimizer   							| 
| Batch size     	|  100 	|
| Epoch size					|		30										|
| Learning rate	      	| 0.001				|

## Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 1
* validation set accuracy of 0.940 

| Data set        		|     Accuracy	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Training       		| 1  							| 
| Validation    	|  0.940 	|

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* The first chosen architecture: 2 conv+2 max pool+ 1 FC
  * Issue with the first architecture: poor accuracy, obviously.
  * Issue details: 
     I faced both under fitting and over-fitting( validation dataset resulted in poor accuracy)
     The following changes were made to tackle the issue:
       a. added a drop-out at FC and convolution
       b. added more hidden layers
       c. adjusted drop out rate per layer
       b. adjusted batch,epoch/learning rate
       c. improved image pre-processing by revisiting normalization

* Steps to improve the accuracy:
  - Found mistakes on normalization equation. 
  - Found validation dataset also needs to be pre-processed. 
  - Found batch size increases, I am facing memory issue.... therefore, traded off with epoch size.
  - I added drop out on FC, it improves a bit, but not that much. The gross improvement arrived by adjusting image pre-processing on validation data set and fixing wrong pre-processing equation. 

* Further improvement (or things I could try) and questions to seek by myself:

  - how can I characterize what hyperparameter can influence more on the accuracy performance
  - try to implement reknown architecture like AlexNet, Nvidia,etc. to see what benefit I can take. 
  - need to explore more about image pre-processing ( at the end of the day, it's all driven by how to extract and polish the image to feed in CNN)
  - I need to learn more matplotlib to visualize data efficiently. 

## Test a Model on New Images

### 1.1 Choose German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

* Here are random German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![random_German_traffic_sign](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/random_german_sign.png)

* After pre-processing:

![random_German_traffic_sign_preprocessing](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/random_german_sign_preprocessed.png)


```python
my_signs = np.array(my_signs)
my_signs_gray = np.sum(my_signs/3, axis=3, keepdims=True)
my_signs_normalized = my_signs_gray/255-1
```

### 1.2 Here is how to resize an image to 32x32 pixel based on another example images:

![random_German_traffic_sign_1](https://github.com/SeokLeeUS/seokleeus.github.io/raw/master/_images/_TrafficIdentifier/random_german_sign_1.png)

#### 1.2.1 how to find the image properties:

```python
# sample signs image shape and other information:
my_signs_array_1 = np.array(my_signs_1)
print('images shape:',my_signs_array_1.shape)

from PIL import Image
import os.path

for i in range(len(my_images_1)):
    file_path = './mysigns/%d.jpg'
    file_path = file_path % (i+1)
    filename = os.path.join(file_path)
    img_test_1 = Image.open(filename)
    width,height = img_test_1.size
    print('Dimensions #',i,':', img_test_1.size,'total pixels:',width*height)
```

#### 1.2.2 how to resize:

```python

for i in range(len(my_images_1)):
    file_path = './mysigns/%d.jpg'
    file_path = file_path % (i+1)
    filename = os.path.join(file_path)
    img_test_2 = Image.open(filename)  
    new_width =  32
    new_height = 32
    img_test_2 = img_test_2.resize((new_width,new_height),Image.ANTIALIAS)
    width,height = img_test_2.size
    print('Dimensions #',i,':', img_test_2.size,'total pixels:',width*height)
    img_test_2.save('./mysigns/resizing/%d_1.jpg' %(i+1))
```

### 2. Discussion

* Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Speed limit(30km/h)     		| Speed limit(30km/h)   									| 
| Bumpy road     			| Bumpy road 										|
| Ahead only 					| Ahead only 										|
| No vehicles	      		| No vehicles					 				|
| Go straight or left			| Go straight or left      							|
| General caution		| General caution      							|


* Used the same training model, and hyperparameters which achieved 100% accuracy during training. 

The model was able to correctly guess 6 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%. 


```python
### Calculate the accuracy for these 5 new images. 
### For example, if the model predicted 1 out of 5 signs correctly, it's 20% accurate on these new images.
my_single_item_array = []
my_single_item_label_array = []

for i in range(6):
    my_single_item_array.append(my_signs_normalized[i])
    my_single_item_label_array.append(my_labels[i])

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
#         saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('./lenet.meta')
        saver.restore(sess, "./lenet")
        my_accuracy = evaluate(my_single_item_array, my_single_item_label_array)
        print('Image {}'.format(i+1))
        print("Image Accuracy = {:.3f}".format(my_accuracy))
        print()

```




### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. 
- stop sign accuracy isn't great and close to a sign (can't recognize the figure surrounded by a stop sign circle), but it puts highest probability to classify stop sign correctly, but onyl 7% difference from another sign posture. 
I may consider more learning to have correct result (Previous submission got me the better result, but it wasn't robust enough as the accuracy is sporatically distributed per each learning execution). 

```python

### Print out the top five softmax probabilities for the predictions on the German traffic sign images found on the web. 
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
k_size = 5
softmax_logits = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
top_k = tf.nn.top_k(softmax_logits, k=k_size)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    my_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('./lenet.meta')
    saver.restore(sess, "./lenet")
    my_softmax_logits = sess.run(softmax_logits, feed_dict={X: my_signs_normalized, is_training:False})
    my_top_k = sess.run(top_k, feed_dict={X: my_signs_normalized, is_training:False})
#     print(my_top_k)

    for i in range(6):
        figures = {}
        labels = {}
        
        figures[0] = my_signs[i]
        labels[0] = "Original"
        
        for j in range(k_size):
#             print('Guess {} : ({:.0f}%)'.format(j+1, 100*my_top_k[0][i][j]))
            labels[j+1] = 'Guess {} : ({:.0f}%)'.format(j+1, 100*my_top_k[0][i][j])
            figures[j+1] = X_valid[np.argwhere(y_valid == my_top_k[1][i][j])[0]].squeeze()
            
#         print()
        plot_figures(figures, 1, 6, labels)

```
